#Kickstarter Analysis Challenge
The purpose of this analysis was to discover trends in kickstarter campaigns. Looking at data ranging from products in technology to plays,
certain patterns regarding the contrast between the amount of money strove for and the amount pledged were exposed. By analyzing
these trends, Louise can take the outcomes of other kickstarter campaigns and keep those patterns in mind when launching her own project.
##How the Analysis was Done
When starting the analysis, I had a table with over 40000 rows of data involving kickstarter projects. Louise's project was a play, so I made charts representing how well theater
campaigns, specifically plays, performed.

This chart shows that theater campaigns tend to be successful. I pulled data to see if the month a campaign launched had any 
correlation with the outcome of the project and made a line graph to display this.

This information was helpful, however I was not able to gather any insight on how Louise's play may perform. I narrowed my data down
to focus on theater projects specifically. The chart below displays the month a theater campaign launched and the trends of the
failed, successful and cancelled projects in this category.

This data would be helpful for Louise to consider when deciding when to launch. However, I could not form a conclusion on
how kickstarters could fail based on these graphs. I reviewed my data again to focus on the financial goals of failed and successful
kickstarters. I noticed that failed kickstarters tended to ask for more money than successful projects. The graph below displays the outcome
of campaigns with the amount of money aimed for.

This data was a bit hard to grasp, so narrowing the chart down to focus on theater projects again was ultimately
the smartest choice to better assist Louise with her play. Below is a box-and-whiskers plot with the orange representing money
pledged.

The box-and-whiskers plot showed clear correlation between the amount of money being asked for and the money pledged.
##Conclusions
When analyzing the chart displaying theater outcomes by launch date, there was a spike in successful projects in May. This 
data suggests it may be a smart idea for Louise to launch her project closer to the spring and summer seasons. In fact, the
successful and failed campaigns interlap in the month of December. This leads to a reasonable assumption that launching in December
may cause the play to not perform as well.
When looking at the outcomes based on the financial goals in the box-and-whiskers plot, I noticed in the theater category that when the goal was higher,
people pledged less money. This could signify that asking for the entire project to be funded on kickstarter has a lower chance
of being successful, or that it is a more viable option to launch smaller projects on kickstarter instead of large campaigns.
While this data set is beneficial when considering Louise's play, there is information missing that could have aided this analysis.
The amount of people surrounding a project could have displayed if kickstarter wasa better resource for entrepreneurs or
small companies. Another piece of data that could have been beneficial to the analysis could include what makes a kickstarter
campaign intriguing to a donator. Further analysis on the algorithm or if the description of the play makes an eye-catching difference could have been helpful for
Louise to consider when advertising her project.
A graph that could have been made to support this analysis could be one depicting the amount of time between the launch
and ending date in order to see how much time is worth allowing a campaign to run for. Another chart idea could include seeing 
what genre of plays perform better on kickstarter.

This analysis has provided Louise with information that could make her play perform successfully. By drawing data from
the months surrounding launch dates, Louise has an idea on when her play could succeed more on kickstarter. By looking
at the ratios between the financial goal of a project and the amount pledged, Louise can have an idea on a realistic 
amount of money to expect from kickstarter.
